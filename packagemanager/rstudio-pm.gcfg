; RStudio Package Manager configuration file

[Server]
; Address is a public URL for this RStudio Package Manager server. If Package Manager
; is deployed behind an HTTP proxy, this should be the URL for Package Manager in
; terms of that proxy. It must be configured if RSPM is served from a subdirectory like
; `/rspm` to facilitate generating URLs for the `rspm url create` command, Swagger docs,
; and PyPI simple index pages.

Address = https://packagemanager.posit.co/

; or `/usr/lib64/R`.
